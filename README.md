# Equation_Balancer
Weâ€™ve all taken that pesky high school chem class where we were asked to balance chemical equations . Now we can easily balance any complex chemical equation accurately within just a few seconds. This project presents a screen & allows to add products & reactants. Upon submission of the form, it balances the equation & renders the result back to the page.

# Add the equation :
